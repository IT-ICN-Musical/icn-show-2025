            In the heart of Yogyakarta, Arya Rahma Aditya rises from family
            disapproval to become a celebrated theater director. Despite his raw
            talent and dedication, success comes at a price â€“ arrogance isolates
            him from his team, and his perfectly crafted world stands on the
            edge of collapse. <br />
            <br />
            When tragedy strikes, this powerful story follows one man's journey
            from triumph to rock bottom, and the path that unfolds in its wake.
